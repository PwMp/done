By using tools like Figma, GitHub, Trello, Slack and etc, we can work better as a team, be more creative, and keep everyone in the loop. </p> </div> </div> <div class="projectmanagementdivider"> <div class="through-this-blog"> Through this blog, we'll share how we created our course project website and give you straightforward instructions so you can make your own website for your design projects. </div> </div> <img class="imgnovvapm-icon" alt src="imgnovva1@2x.f8e78343.png"> <div class="steps"> <div class="step-one"> <div class="description2"> <div class="step-1-introducing"> Step 1: Introducing Our Friend “NOVVA” </div> <div class="plusmark"> <div class="plusmark-child"></div> <img class="plusmark-item" alt src="line@2x.16c2cfa3.png"> <img class="plusmark-inner" alt src="line@2x.16c2cfa3.png"> </div> </div> <img class="projectmanagementline-icon" alt src="projectmanagementline@2x.403f7852.png"> <div class="first-things-first"> First things first, we needed a cool idea to connect all our projects on the website. So, we came up with this awesome concept. It's like having a theme that ties everything together, making it more interesting to the user. We decided to create a character. But here's the cool part: we used AI (that's artificial intelligence) to make this character. </div> <div class="first-things-first"> Having a character like “Novva” can bring several benefits to our website. It adds personality, relatability, and memorability to your product. It helps create a connection with our audience and can serve as a recognizable symbol for our team. </div> <div class="you-can-read"> If you are interested in making a character for yourself with AI, you can read our detailed explanation here. </div> </div> <div class="step-one"> <div class="description2"> <div class="step-1-introducing">Step 2: Getting Creative</div> <div class="plusmark"> <div class="plusmark-child"></div> <img class="plusmark-item" alt src="line@2x.16c2cfa3.png"> <img class="plusmark-inner" alt src="line@2x.16c2cfa3.png"> </div> </div> <img class="projectmanagementline-icon" alt src="projectmanagementline@2x.403f7852.png"> <div class="first-things-first"> So, after we had our cool idea and our friendly character ready, it was time to make our website look awesome. For that we used Figma. Figma is a virtual canvas where we can draw, design, and put everything together. The focus of our work was to learn project management. As we designed our website, we also got better at using project management tools like Figma. These tools helped us stay organized and made it easier to work together, even when we're apart. It's like having a handy digital toolbox to keep everything in order. </div> <div class="you-can-read"> You can read here the entire design procedure of our team website. </div> </div> <div class="step-one"> <div class="description2"> <div class="step-1-introducing">Step 3: Let’s Code!</div> <div class="plusmark"> <div class="plusmark-child"></div> <img class="plusmark-item" alt src="line@2x.16c2cfa3.png"> <img class="plusmark-inner" alt src="line@2x.16c2cfa3.png"> </div> </div> <img class="projectmanagementline-icon" alt src="projectmanagementline@2x.403f7852.png"> <div class="first-things-first"> With our finalized design, we opened up Visual Studio. In Visual Studio, we wrote the code that makes our website come to life. We had do focus not only about the nice design of our webpage, but also the responsiveness and smoothness. This meant checking if buttons clicked, pages scrolled, and everything felt just right. </div> <div class="you-can-read"> You can get our detailed guideline about the procedure of converting the Figma design to HTML/CSS and JavaScript code from here. </div> </div> <div class="step-one"> <div class="description2"> <div class="step-1-introducing">Step 4: Github</div> <div class="plusmark"> <div class="plusmark-child"></div> <img class="plusmark-item" alt src="line@2x.16c2cfa3.png"> <img class="plusmark-child8" alt src="line@2x.16c2cfa3.png"> </div> </div> <img class="projectmanagementline-icon" alt src="projectmanagementline@2x.403f7852.png"> <div class="first-things-first"> GitHub is a digital platform where we can store and manage our code. It's not just for storing code, it's is a handy tool when you are coding as a team. It helps us keep things organized and work together without getting in each other's way. GitHub also lets us know when someone has made changes to the code. It's like having a chat with our teammates, and they're telling us, "Hey, I updated this part!" That way, we can all stay on the same page and avoid any confusion. At the end GitHub will help our website to become live. </div> <div class="you-can-read"> You can have a look here to understand how did we make our website live. </div> </div> <div class="step-six"> <div class="description6"> <div class="step-1-introducing">Step 5: Conclusion</div> <div class="plusmark"> <div class="plusmark-child"></div> <img class="plusmark-item" alt src="line@2x.16c2cfa3.png"> <img class="plusmark-inner" alt src="line@2x.16c2cfa3.png"> </div> </div> <img class="projectmanagementline-icon" alt src="projectmanagementline@2x.403f7852.png"> <div class="by-choosing-to"> By choosing to design our own website from scratch, we not only had a unique platform but also the opportunity to learn new skills and enhance our project management abilities. The project allowed us to practice teamwork, planning, problem-solving, and effective communication. As a result, we've become more proficient in handling complex projects and working together as a team, which will undoubtedly benefit us in future endeavors. </div> </div> </div> <footer class="footer10"> <footer class="footer-section4"> <div class="home-button4" id="homeButtonContainer"> <div class="home6">Home</div> </div> <div class="copyright10"> <div class="home6">© | Designed by Team Novva | 2023</div> </div> <div class="scroll-up-button4" id="scrollUpButton"> <div class="home6">Scroll Up</div> </div> </footer> </footer> </div> <script>var e=document.getElementById("characterDevelopmentText");e&&e.addEventListener("click",function(e){window.location.href="./ProjecctManagementTwo.html"});var t=document.getElementById("designText");t&&t.addEventListener("click",function(e){window.location.href="./ProjectManagementThree.html"});var n=document.getElementById("developmentText");n&&n.addEventListener("click",function(e){window.location.href="./ProjectManagementFour.html"});var o=document.getElementById("deploymentText");o&&o.addEventListener("click",function(e){window.location.href="./ProjectManagementFive.html"});var c=document.getElementById("homeButtonContainer");c&&c.addEventListener("click",function(e){window.location.href="./HomePage.html"});var a=document.getElementById("scrollUpButton");a&&a.addEventListener("click",function(){var e=document.querySelector("[data-scroll-to='navigationBar']");e&&e.scrollIntoView({block:"start",behavior:"smooth"})});</script> </body></html>
